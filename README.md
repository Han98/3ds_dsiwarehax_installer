This is a 3DS homebrew application for installing DSiWare savedata exploits, for DSiWare titles which you already have installed. This is intended as a .3dsx which requires access to SVCs which are normally not accessible(**arm11kernelhax/whatever required**).

The input savedata size must be <=0x20000. Due to this the DSiWare grtpwn exploit can't installed currently.

Eventually a release-archive containing the app + the required DSiWare exploits should be released.
